COMP-4300-VHDL---MIPS-Processor
===============================

MIPS processor in VHDL. Here is the project description.

This lab builds the MIPS controller and gets a few instructions running.

Develop VHDL for the MIPS controller and instruction decoder entities. You should develop an architecture for each of the entities given below. A template for the architecture of the controller is also given, just so you won't get way off track by starting off wrong. I've also given you all the other entities that were left out of lab three. THIS BUILDS ON THE LAB THREE3 RESULTS, SO IF YOU DON'T HAVE THOSE WORKING, THAT IS YOUR FIRST TASK. The entity declarations for the controller and decoder are at the ftp site in the file lab4_control_v3.vhd.

Develop some remaining components not asked for in LAB 3. These include a one-bit register (to store the jump condition code), a five-bit mux (to handle write-back register index). The entity declarations for these components are in the file lab4_datapath_v4.vhd on Canvas.

I am giving you the entities for the memories IM and DM in the file lab4_datapath_v4.vhd on Blackboard. The IM and DM memories bear some mention. Your processor should start loading instructions from address 0 of the instruction memory (IM), then load subsequent instructions from address 4, 8, etc. We are not handling jumps yet. To make things easier, the IM entity returns you a full DLX word from the address you ask for. It is just a 1023 element array of dlx_word . The only way I have implemented for entering your program is for you to pre-load the IM with some hard-coded instructions. I've preloaded one for you at address zero:

 LW R1,4092(R0) 
 

That is the first instruction you should get working. You should develop test programs for all the instructions you are expected to implement (see below).

The global wiring for the MIPS is found in a file on Blackboard lab4_mips_v5.vhd . This defines the top-level entity mips and connects the components.

You should test the mips entity by developing simulation files for the entity. You will of course have to do unit testing on the instruction decoder and dlx controller, but I don't want to see those results unless you have problems and have a question.

The only input to the MIPS itself is an external clock. This clock will have a 200ns cycle time (i.e. it is zero from time 0 to time 100, 1 from time 101 to time 200, 0 from 201 to 300, etc.). This is long enough to let all the 5 ns delays run out before the clock cycle ends.

You should use the dlx_types package in the datapath file to for the various pieces of a dlx word.

Propagation delays through the decoder and controller should be 5 ns, just like the other functional units.

Instruction Decoder This is just another piece of combinational logic that takes an instruction as input and chops it into the appropriate component pieces. If a field is not used for a particular type of instruction, set it to zero (won't matter, because it won't be used).

MIPS Controller This is a 5-state machine that handles the clock inputs to all the latches, sets the control inputs to the multiplexors, and converts the function code into a 4-bit code and signed bit for the ALU. It should implement the MIPS architecture exactly as described in textbook sections A.3 (but no pipeline). Each instruction will take 5 cycles to execute, and instruction execution will not overlap.

Opcodes and function codes Here are the opcodes and function codes you will need to run MIPS instructions. Ignore the 5-bit "shamt" filed in instructions. All the function codes we will use fit in the 6-bit "funct" field (Textbook figure 2.27). These are the ONLY operations I want you to spend time on, until you get these all running. If you do get them all, and want some more, come and see me for extra credit.

ModelSIM is needed to run any of these files. Included are screen shots of all of the instructions being tested and their results.
